## Overview

Voluntrax is a web-based platform accessible via Voluntrax.com on any web-browser. The product is designed to streamline volunteer management for volunteers, event coordinators, and administrators. Volunteers can sign in at events using a device with a camera to scan QR codes or be manually logged by coordinators. They can also request a report of their hours to be sent to their email. For volunteers without active email accounts, a digest of their hours can be requested from event coordinators. Event Coordinators have access to a secure dashboard which allows them to perform various actions in location, volunteer and check-in management. Along with this coordinators have access to cleanly organized data of volunteer hours which can be printed or saved to a spreadsheet. Administrative accounts oversee high-level operations, including organization creation, registration code generation, and user management. Along with this there are options to filter, delete, or reassign user roles. The platform ensures efficient tracking and management of volunteer activities with intuitive web-based access.
